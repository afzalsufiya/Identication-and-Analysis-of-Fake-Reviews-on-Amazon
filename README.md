# Identification and Analysis of Fake Customer Reviews - An Empirical Study on Customer Reviews from Amazon (Master Thesis)


This repository contains the code and data for the master thesis project aimed at identifying and analysing fake consumer reviews on Amazon. The project leverages advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques, including the use of the RoBERTa model, to develop a robust review detection algorithm. 


## Project Overview

The study aims to measure the frequency of fraudulent reviews on Amazon and investigate the factors that differentiate genuine reviews from fraudulent ones. The method classifies reviews as authentic or fraudulent by implementing deep learning techniques. The primary goals also include understanding the variation in review rates across various attributes like product categories, product ratings, review length and identifying specific classification patterns or relations between these attributes. The research includes best fitting of various machine learning models to understand the classification patterns in honest and fake customer reviews.

This thesis makes a substantial contribution to our knowledge of fraudulent reviews on Amazon and how they affect consumer behavior. The results will help consumers, researchers, and e-commerce platforms by shedding light on the prevalence, patterns, and identification of consumer reviews. Furthermore, the study shows how modern machine learning models can be used to improve the dependability of online customer evaluations.
